# Public Good Opensource Beer
Public Good offers an opensource beer recipe so you can create your own beer.

Public Good IPA is a unique beer born from the culture of NFT communities. Inspired by the open source movement, its recipe, brand and label are in the public domain.

Originally from Brazil, the beer brand was inspired by the collaborative spirit of NFT projects such as NounsDAO and aims to create a legitimate link between the web3 universe and the real world.

**Innovative Concept**
    
Public Good IPA has its recipe, brand and label available to the public on its website, allowing anyone to make their own beer or use the brand's elements to their liking.
    
**Funding and Growth**
    
With recent funding of 45,000 dollars from NounsDAO (https://nouns.wtf/vote/378), Public Good IPA has plans to expand its operations in 5 global locations, in addition to Brazil and Portugal, where it was already launched in June (in partnership with Cervejaria Narcose) and October (in partnership with Cervejaria Canil), respectively.
    
**Community and Collaboration**
    
Public Good IPA acts as a platform aimed at bringing web3 projects and protocols closer to the consumer market, integrating NFT artworks and free token distribution into the label design, such as the Polygon-based gotas.social (http://gotas.social).

**Next Steps**
    
The brand has ambitious plans that go beyond beer and explore other product categories with a more social character. The aim is to continue spreading the brand's message and the possibilities of the web3.
